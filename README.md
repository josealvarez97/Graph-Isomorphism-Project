# Graph-Isomorphism-Project

To understand what is going on here, please check out the detailed [documentation](https://github.com/josealvarez97/Graph-Isomorphism-Project/tree/master/Documentation) - which is in Spanish, though. But it's very good documentation (at least check out the diagrams and pictures of the [Technical Manual](../master/Documentation/Entrega/Documentacion/Manuales/MANUAL_TECNICO_PROYECTO.pdf) :wink:).
